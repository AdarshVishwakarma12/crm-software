## Environment Variables

The app uses environment variables for email configuration (send-feedback section).

In `docker-compose.yml` / `Dockerfile`, placeholder values are provided for development:

```yaml
EMAIL_HOST_USER=none@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=None
```

These are **not real credentials**. To use actual email features, replace them with valid SMTP credentials.

## Disclaimer

> This project is actively being improved and is intended for educational or small-scale personal use. While fully functional, it may lack the scalability and advanced features found in commercial CRM systems.
